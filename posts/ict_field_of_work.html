                        <h1>What did I do?</h1>
                        <p>In a nutshell, my work was divided to database manager (DM) and head of
                            technical support.
                            <br>
                            My responsibilities were for example,<br>
                            team managing, important data requests, training interns, managing database
                            operations,<br>
                            sending information for the
                            <a

                                Finnish IRS</a>
                            from our end-customer earnings.
                            <br>
                            <i>We started sending the data using GitBash and it took 8 hours per week to
                                send all the salary + expense data using that method.
                                <br>
                                That doesn't include the amount of time that took to get the response from IRS
                                and importing the data to the database.</i>
                        </p>
                        <h1>What did my usual tasks were as a database manager?</h1>
                        <p>
                            Well usually the database manager is a person who is behind the scenes<br>
                            and makes sure that the data that comes from a website, for example, is stored
                            correctly to the database.<br>
                            My work as something similar, but it was mostly for finding issues on the
                            production<br>
                            and fixing them while telling the developers about the bugs that they have
                            created so that our work wouldn't be too boring.
                            <br>
                            I was also responsible to the board and CEO to get their data requests, as our
                            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-big-data" target="_blank">BIG Data</a>

                        <h1>How was the work as a head of technical support?</h1>
                        <p>Well, the technical support part was more supporting the office,
                            <br>
                            helping with printers, helping different teams with their technical
                            difficulties.<br>
                            I was also responsible for my team and their effectiveness, with a budget of 0€.
                            <br>
                            We also held

                            with my team to make sure that everyone was fine,
                            <br>
                            specially during the times when we had +2 hours of overwork per day. <br>
                            <i>PRO TIP. Usually at the work it's the same people who will ask help, and
                                mostly it's about the same issues.<br>
                                Have a documentation and make it "idiot proof", that everyone can read it, it
                                saves you a LOT of time and grey hairs, trust me.</i><br>
