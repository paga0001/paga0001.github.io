                        <h3>Study Choise Activities</h3>
                        <p>I started programming just when I started my previous school. <br>
                            I quickly learned the basics <br>
                            and was able to get a job and become database expert.

                        <h3>Motivation and Hobbies</h3>
                        <p> I've always had a strong interest in streaming and game development, <br>
                            which have been passions of mine since my childhood and teenage years. <br>
                            Over time, my curiosity, particularly about the behind-the-scenes aspects of these fields, has only deepened. <br>
                            This is why I decided to study game development and I would want to learn more of it.

                        <h3>What do you see yourself doing after completing the program?</h3>
                        <p>I'm hoping to either start a company or get a job in the same work area. <br>
                            I'm interested in working with AI, developing databases, or designing and creating games. <br>
                            I'm also open to continuing my studies further.
