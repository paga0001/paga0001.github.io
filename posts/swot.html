                        <h2>Strengths</h2>
                        <p>For the last four years, I've been with this cool company, kind of a light entrepreneurship gig, where I've really gotten to sharpen my tech skills. I've tackled all sorts of stuff - fixing database problems, writing up docs, and throwing in my two cents at sprint meetings. Plus, I've really gotten the hang of how our whole system ticks. <br>
                            <br>
                            There's also this neat thing I've been doing - taking the stuff our senior devs write up and translating it into plain English so the whole team can get it. That actually came in super handy once when I caught a glitch in a query. Just by tweaking it to add an 'is_active = 1' check, we fixed some data that we'd reported wrong to the tax folks.<br>
                            <br>
                            And I've not just been coding; I've led our tech support team too. I kind of reshaped how we do things, gave the team more freedom, and man, did that work! We slashed our ticket numbers in half because we trained the other departments better. That freed us up to dig into the trickier problems that pop up in our system.</p><br>
                        <h2>Weaknessess</h2>
                        <p>Looking back to when I finished school, I'd have told you my weaknesses were public speaking, handling complex problems, seeing the big picture, and time management. But, you know, life has a way of teaching you. These past four years working and my time in the army 8.5 months, to be exact, really changed me. The army gave me a boost in confidence and patience, while managing teams taught me how to keep track of time and see beyond just my immediate tasks.<br>
                            <br>
                            Now, if you ask me about my weaknesses, I'd say it's more about networking and building professional relationships. I've got a pretty good start back home in Finland, but moving to the Netherlands and starting school there is like hitting the reset button. It's a bit daunting, especially for us Finns, I guess. But I'm hoping the skills and experiences I've picked up in Finland will help me find my feet in the Netherlands too.</p><br>
                        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
                        <p>The world's moving fast. It's growing and changing all the time, and I really want to be part of that change. My goal is to make sure we're using technology in the best and most effective ways possible.<br>
                            <br>
                            One thing that really excites me is the potential of AI in gaming. I'm super curious to see how much more we can integrate AI into games, and I'm keen to see what that means for gamers and how it could totally change the game when it comes to NPCs.<br>
                            <br>
                            Also, I'm definitely looking for an internship. I think it's important not to get too narrow-focused. Even though I'm studying one specific area, I'm open to other fields too. I reckon this could give me a much more rounded view of things, rather than just having tunnel vision.</p><br>
                        <h2>Threats</h2>
                        <p>I've got a few concerns, honestly. The biggest one is moving to a totally new place where they speak a different language. I mean, I know a little Dutch or Flemish, but I definitely need to brush up on it.<br>
                            <br>
                            Also, I'm a bit worried that my coursework might be super intense and stressful. And, of course, there's the money side of things. I've got some savings and my family's backing me up, but it's still something that's on my mind a lot.</p>
