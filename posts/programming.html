                        <p>The first time I touched anykind of coding was in 2017, 
                            when I started my studies in Helsinki Business College in Finland. <br>
                            I had no previous experience before this and I was quite worried if it would be "my thing". <br>
                            Now, 7 years later I can say that I haven't reget it at all. <br>
                            <br>
                            I'm mostly experienced with MySQL that I have been using the past 
                            4-5 years actively mostly in my work. <br>
                            Other languages are HTML, CSS, PhP, Javascript, Java and react.js
